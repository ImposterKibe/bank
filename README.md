# Bank
A Python program that implements a banking system through the use of object orientation.
This program is a text based equivalent of an ATM interface. It has the functionality to allow for some pretty basic and common transactions that checkings accounts provide.

# Skill level
I subjectively rate this project as having required an intermediate skill level to be implemented to the extend that I have.

# What I learned
1. Collaboration on open-source projects.
2. Version control best practices such as:
 - making small and regular commits
 - providing meaningful commit messages.
3. How objects work in Python.
4. Proper documentation techniques and standards used in Python.
